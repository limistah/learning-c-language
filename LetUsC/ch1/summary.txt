An expression may contain any sequence of constants, variables and operators.
Operators having equal precedence are evaluated using associativity.
Left to right associativity means that the left operand of a operator must be unambiguous whereas right to left associativity means that the right operand of a operator must be unambiguous.
Input/output in C can be achieved using scanf( ) and printf( ) functions.
